        <p>Tourism New Zealand is the organisation responsible for marketing New Zealand to the world as a tourist destination. The major tool we use to do this is the 100% Pure New Zealand marketing campaign, a campaign that has evolved over the past two decades to make New Zealand one of the world's most well-respected tourism brands.
          International tourism has grown to become New Zealand's largest earner of foreign exchange, pumping around NZD14.5 billion annually into the nation's economy. Over 3.7 million visitors arrive in the country every year. (updated December 2017) 
          Understandably, an industry of this magnitude does not grow by itself. In a fiercely contested global tourism marketplace, Tourism New Zealand is responsible for ensuring New Zealand remains attractive internationally as a visitor destination.
          Through the 100% Pure New Zealand campaign we take New Zealand's story to consumers, the travel trade and the global media, while working with the industry here in New Zealand to ensure we deliver on the promises made through the campaign.
